# Serverless-PHP

Serverless-PHP is a simple, lightweight, and object oriented framework based on Bref, which simplifies the application development process using handlers (similar to the Components in Angular Framework) on AWS using Lambda Functions and API Gateway.
Serverless-PHP manages requests from API Gateway, their routing, and formats response to return from the function to the user through API Gateway.
